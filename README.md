# Projet Nutrition

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Projet Nutrition is to investigate the effect of the sugar
feeding on activity rythm of anopheles mosquitoes. For this, two group
of female were fed with a solution of 5% or 0.5% of sucrose and then,
their activity was recorded using a locomotor activity monitor (LAM)
during 5 days.

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
